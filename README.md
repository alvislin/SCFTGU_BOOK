#### Quotes

From the currently broken website <http://www.scftgu.com>:

> This new edition of an industry best seller is updated to reflect the
> standardization of SystemC as IEEE 1666 and other improvements that reflect
> feedback from readers of the first edition. The wide ranging feedback also
> include suggestions from editors of the Japanese and Korean language
> translations, professors and students, and computer engineers from a broad
> industrial and geographical spectrum, all who have successfully used the first
> edition.

> New chapters have been added on the SystemC Verification Library and the
> Transaction Level Modeling, and proposed changes to the current SystemC
> standard.

> David Black and Jack Donovan, well known consultants in the EDA industry, have
> teamed with Bill Bunton and Anna Keist, experienced SystemC modeling
> engineers, to write the second edition of this highly popular classic. As
> a team the authors bring over 100 years of ASIC and system design experience
> together to make a very readable introduction to SystemC.
